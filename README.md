### Map Layers

Customized map overlays of your city of choice.  Filterable displays allow you to see the AirBnb locations as they related to various points of interest.  Walkability, proximity to bars and other entertainment, museums and more!

### Machine Learning Helps You Decide

Our machine learning algorithm tells you if the AirBnb you've chosen is a good cost value based on many, many factors, including proximity to city center, cleaning fees, deposits, and host review scores.
